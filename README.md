# JavaScript Projects

Welcome to my JavaScript Projects repository!

This repository contains all the coding assignments, challenges, and projects I complete throughout my JavaScript course.

Each folder within this repository will represent a different topic or project, and will include all the code Iâ€™ve written as part of the learning process.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Track my learning journey and progress.
- Provide a centralized place for my instructor to review my work.
- Begin building my professional portfolio using GitHub.

Please note: No code will be deleted from this repository unless explicitly instructed. All submissions will be retained as a record of my work.

I will continuously push updates to this repository as I complete more tasks. 

Thank you for visiting!
